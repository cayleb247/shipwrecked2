## Description

Turn emojis of a subject, verb, and object into an image. Image generatation is handled using DALL-E from Open AI. After the image is generated, computer vision is used to determine if the user is satisfied with the result. If the user is unsatisified a new image will be generated until they are satisfied with the output image.
